step-1: create a project

step-2: create a java class where we can write all the database related code.

step-3: that class must extends the SQLiteOpenHelper this class provides the two important method onCreate() and
        onUpdate() to create and update the data which should be implements and create a constructer.

step-4: angin  create one more constcuter with only Context object beacuse it take the class referance and we are
        going to define the database name and factroy and version name by this class not by activity class.
        the factroy used to read the data from the database by row by row. version about database meanse when we create database then
         database version in 1 and after creating database what ever we change in database like table create , insert data
         then version will increse by 1

step-5: now create then details of dataabse , factrory and version in that class

step-6: so when at first time we create object for this class then autometically onCreate() method will call at first
        time to create database.
        then if you again create object for it then first it will check for database if not created it onCick will call otherwise
        onUpdate() method will call.

step-7: write create statement in onCreate() method to create table.
step-8: update database.


video- 89 -> before do any operation on database first we shoulb to open the database and then do operation on that and after
            complete of operation on database we shoulb to close it also.

step-1: write the code in onCreate() method below

        // to open the database
        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();
        // to close the database
        db.close();
